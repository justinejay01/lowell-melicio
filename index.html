                                        <p> The morphological and physiological structure of the male reproductive
                                            system is different from the female reproductive system. The external and
                                            internal parts differ in size and shape as well as its functions. Though the
                                            parts and functions of the reproductive system are different in some
                                            aspects, they are coordinated parts and functions. The role of the male
                                            reproductive system is to produce and transport sperm cells while the female
                                            reproductive system is to produce egg cells and for child-bearing. Without

                                        <p> The sperm cell is a unique structure located in the testis. It fertilizes
                                            the egg. Males have two testes found inside the scrotum. It produces
                                            millions of minute sperm cells which can be observed only under the
                                            microscope. The sperm cell which comes from the testes, and travels in the
                                            epididymis are temporarily stored until they are released. The sperm cells
                                            are release and move along the vas deferens. Along the way, the sperms
                                            combined with the nutrient secretions from the prostate gland and seminal
                                            vesicles. This mixture is called semen. The semen will be transported into
                                            the urethra and out of the penis. </p>

                                                <strong>Ovaries:</strong> The two ovaries are small and almond-shaped
                                                organs. They are located inside the female, one on each side of the body
                                                a few inches below the waist. The ovaries secrete hormones called
                                                estrogen and progesterone to produce mature egg cells. Egg cells begin
                                                to mature when the female reaches puberty. During puberty, ovaries
                                                usually produce and release one ripened egg every 28 days. This process
                                                is called ovulation.

                                            Hormones play an important role that regulates the function of a specific
                                            organ of the body. These are regulating and complex chemical substances
                                            secreted by the endocrine glands that are carried through the blood stream
                                            to the target organ in many areas of the body. The hormones of the
                                            reproductive system carry a specific role during puberty, ovulation,
                                            pregnancy, and development. The reproductive glands are controlled by the
                                            pituitary gland, which is controlled by the hypothalamus. The reproductive
                                            glands of boys and girls work at low levels until the age of 10. After this
                                            age, hormone levels begin to increase, and physical changes start to
                                            develop. The hypothalamus releases chemical substances that signal the
                                            pituitary gland to start producing two hormones responsible for reproduction
                                            – the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Both
                                            males and females produce these kinds of hormone. They affect the testes in
                                            men and the ovaries in women.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The LH of the male sends signals in the testes to produce testosterone with
                                            FSH to control the production of the sperm and the growth of facial hair. In
                                            females, the pituitary hormones LH and FSH stimulate the ovaries to produce
                                            estrogen and progesterone. These hormones are responsible to produce ova or
                                            mature egg cells. Other roles of the reproductive hormone are listed below.

                                            Females begin to menstruate between the ages of 11 and 15. Menstruation, or
                                            monthly period, is the monthly shedding of the lining of the uterus.

                                            <li>Menstrual cycle begins when an egg matures or ripens in one of the
                                                ovaries. At the same time, the endometrium, the lining of the uterus,
                                                starts to thicken for possible pregnancy. </li>
                                            <li>The matured egg releases from the ovary. The lining of the uterus
                                                continuously thickens until it is ready to receive the fertilized egg.

                                            <li>If pregnancy does not successfully happen, the endometrium breaks down
                                                or is destroyed and discharged from the body. This discharge of blood

                                                cycles as short as 21 days, or as long as 35 days and are considered

                                            <li>During the first half of the cycle (days 1-14), pituitary hormone FSH
                                                stimulates an egg to mature inside one of the ovaries.</li>
                                            <li>When the egg starts to develop, it secretes estrogen which causes the
                                                endometrium to thicken. </li>
                                            <li>At the middle of menstrual cycle, which is about day 14, the level of LH
                                                (Luteinizing Hormone) starts to rise; thus, ovulation occurs. </li>
                                            <li>The ovary releases the egg and travels into the fallopian tube. </li>
                                            <li>It takes seven days for the egg to travel into the fallopian tube going
                                                to the uterus. </li>
                                            <li>The production of the progesterone increases after the time the egg
                                                reaches the uterus. As the progesterone increases, it maintains the
                                                growth of the endometrium. </li>
                                            <li>If the egg has not been fertilized, progesterone and estrogen levels
                                                drop. The endometrium breaks down and the unfertilized egg passes out of
                                                the body through the vagina.</li>

                                                called fertilization. After fertilization of the egg cell, the zygote
                                                travels in the oviduct to get nutrients from maternal secretions, then
                                                will undergo the process of first mitotic cell division which forms
                                                cleavages. When it reaches the uterus, cleavages have transformed into a
                                                solid group of cells called morula and later on will develop into a
                                                blastocyst. There is an inner cell mass of the blastocysts having a
                                                surface cell layer called the trophoblast.

                                                Secretion of chorionic gonadotropin from trophoblast helps to maintain
                                                the corpus luteum to grow and to secrete estrogens and progesterone.
                                                These hormones help the uterine lining to do its task during pregnancy.
                                                Once the blastocyst is formed, it begins to adhere itself to the uterine
                                                lining. This process of attachment is also known as implantation. After
                                                the blastocyst has been implanted, it is now called embryo.

                                                Embryo is the initial development stage in human after fertilization.
                                                The bond that holds the embryo to the wall of the uterus is called the
                                                placenta. Approximately 25 days, after fertilization, a cord forms
                                                between the embryo and the sac (called the placenta). This cord is
                                                referred to as the umbilical cord which is the embryo's lifeline,
                                                meaning the embryo gets its oxygen and food from the mother through the
                                                placenta.
                                                The developing embryo is enclosed in a sac of thin sheet of tissue
                                                called the amniotic sac. Within this sac is the amniotic fluid where the
                                                embryo floats. This fluid serves as a shock absorber and helps the

                                                After two months, the embryo is about 1.2 inches (3 centimeters) long
                                                and has a recognizable human form or a fetus. The fetus grows with the
                                                help of the placenta. The placenta connects to the developing embryo by
                                                means of the umbilical cord. At four months, the fetus moves and can be
                                                recognized. The baby's eyelashes are formed, and eyelids can be
                                                recognized at seven months. All the organs are well developed on the
                                                ninth month; the baby is ready to be born.

                                        <h5>THE ENDOCRINE AND NERVOUS SYSTEM</h5>
                                        <p>The endocrine system is made up of a group of organs called endocrine glands.
                                            A gland is the smallest living unit in the body that produces and releases a
                                            chemical substance called hormones. In the previous lesson, you have studied
                                            the different glands and specific role in the reproductive organs. Now, let
                                            us explain the overall function of this system in the body.</p>

                                                Endocrine system are consists of many glands which secretes hormones
                                                directly into the bloodstream to regulate daily activities of the body
                                                and controls its overall development. The hormones act as chemical
                                                messengers in the body which stimulates many organs such as the ovaries
                                                and the testes.

                                                Endocrine system is also known as the "system of checks and balances"
                                                that works to keep the body system healthy. One of the instances when
                                                the endocrine system is working properly is by sending chemical signals
                                                to another gland which responds by controlling the chemicals of the
                                                first gland.

                                                It is similar to thermostat (temperature regulator) because it may turn
                                                on when the temperature is below normal and may turn off when the
                                                temperature is above normal, thus the endocrine system turns on and off
                                                in response to the level of hormones in the body.

                                                When the endocrine system is not properly doing its job, the over health
                                                of the body may be affected such as energy level, physical appearance
                                                and the ability to produce offspring.

                                            Sensors are receptors which are responsible in gathering information about
                                            the conditions inside and outside of the body. For instance, during summer
                                            or winter, your skin and nostrils sensors function as receptors in gathering
                                            data information about the temperature. The skin is made up of many internal
                                            sensors that detect changes in the environment. The human body is made up of
                                            sensory neurons which carry impulses to the brain or spinal cord.

                                            system. The brain receives information from the sensors. It then examines
                                            the information to the ideal values (set point) in which the body functions
                                            well. If the set point is below the control center quickly responds by
                                            sending messages through the communicating systems-the nervous system and

                                            The nervous system and the endocrine system are the communicating systems of
                                            the body. They carry the information to all parts of the body. Through nerve
                                            impulse and hormones dictates the target cell or organs in the body how to

                                            directly diffused into the bloodstream. The hormones will travel to the
                                            different parts of the body. Only the target cells have receptors to which
                                            the specific type of hormone can bind. The response occurs when the hormones
                                            lock, and key binding triggers the target tissue.

                                            Many functions of the body and processes operate using feedback systems. The

                                            activated by many feedback systems. To maintain normal cell functions of the
                                            body, intracellular and extracellular substances in the environments, such

                                            cells in the uterus signal the hypothalamus to release oxytocin hormone into
                                            the bloodstream, which causes the uterus to contract. Feedback regulation
                                            can be either positive or negative.

                                            Negative feedback is a control system to reduce or minimize any changes or
                                            conditions of the body, which keeps the whole body system stable. It is also
                                            a mechanism that regulates homeostasis. The term negative is a deviation
                                            from set point. The set point refers to the normal value and ideal
                                            requirement of the body to maintain homeostasis.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The secretions of hormones from the endocrine glands are under the control
                                            of hypothalamus which is also controlled by negative feedback. Increased
                                            breathing is a good example of how a negative feedback loop works. Oxygen is
                                            necessary for breathing in order for the proper functioning of the body and
                                            to secrete carbon dioxide. Due to the presence of high levels of carbon
                                            dioxide in extracellular fluid, breathing increases and therefore oxygen
                                            supply increases in the air in the lungs. As a result, counteracts the high
                                            amounts of carbon dioxide. High level of carbon dioxide is harmful to the
                                            body. Negative feedback loops maintain state of balance by reversing change
                                            to return its normal condition of the body.

                                        <p>
                                            Another example of a negative feedback mechanism is when the levels of
                                            glucose (sugar) in the blood are regulated the hormone insulin. When blood
                                            sugar increases in the body, the receptors in the body detect a change. Due
                                            to this condition, the pancreas release insulin into the blood effectively
                                            to lower down the sugar level. The pancreas stops releasing insulin once the
                                            blood glucose level reach homeostasis.

                                        <p>
                                            Positive feedback is a control system which uses information from sensors to
                                            increase the rate of processes. It is also exact opposite of a negative
                                            feedback mechanism. This type of feedback is important whenever a rapid
                                            change is necessary. It deviates from a set point; therefore, it becomes
                                            greater which makes a bad situation worse. This type of feedback is rarely
                                            found in healthy people For instance, if you cut your finger, positive
                                            feedback mechanism is used in the production of nerve impulse and increase
                                            the rate of change in blood clotting until the wound is sealed. Another
                                            example of positive feedback system is during child birth. During labor, the
                                            oxytocin release in the uterus intensifies and speeds up contractions. The
                                            release of oxytocin stops when the baby is born. The birth ends the release
                                            of oxytocin and ends the positive feedback mechanism.
